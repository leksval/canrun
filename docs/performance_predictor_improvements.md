# Performance Predictor Simplification & Improvements

## Current Problems with `dynamic_performance_predictor.py`

### 1. **Excessive Complexity** (1184 lines)
- Monolithic class trying to do everything
- Deeply nested conditions making logic hard to follow
- Mixed responsibilities (detection, calculation, assessment)

### 2. **Unbounded FPS Calculations**
```python
# Current problematic code:
predicted_fps = int(base_fps_value * gpu_ratio * cpu_modifier * resolution_factor)
fps = int(fps * fps_modifier)  # Another multiplier!
fps = int(fps * 1.3)  # Yet another multiplier!
fps += 20  # Plus flat additions!
# Result: Can predict 1000+ FPS for games, which is unrealistic
```

### 3. **No Clear Bounds or Validation**
- Missing upper limits on FPS predictions
- No context-aware maximum values
- No validation against known benchmarks

## Elegant Solution: `fps_calculator.py`

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Simple, Clear Architecture** (430 lines)
```python
class SimplifiedFPSCalculator:
    # Clear data structures
    BASE_FPS_1080P = {"Ultra": 60, "High": 75, ...}
    RESOLUTION_FACTORS = {"720p": 1.5, "1080p": 1.0, ...}
    
    def calculate_fps(...) -> FPSPrediction:
        # Linear, understandable flow
        base_fps = self.BASE_FPS_1080P[quality]
        fps = base_fps * resolution * gpu * game * cpu
        bounded_fps = self._apply_realistic_bounds(fps)
        return FPSPrediction(fps, confidence, ...)
```

#### 2. **Bounded Calculations**
```python
# Realistic maximum FPS by context
max_fps_limits = {
    ("1080p", GameProfile.ESPORTS): 300,
    ("1080p", GameProfile.STANDARD): 165,
    ("4K", GameProfile.DEMANDING): 45,
}
bounded_fps = min(fps, max_fps)
```

#### 3. **Game Profiles Instead of Complex Logic**
```python
class GameProfile(Enum):
    ESPORTS = "esports"      # CS2, Valorant
    OPTIMIZED = "optimized"   # Fortnite, Apex
    STANDARD = "standard"     # Most AAA games
    DEMANDING = "demanding"   # Cyberpunk, RDR2
```

#### 4. **Confidence Scoring**
```python
@dataclass
class FPSPrediction:
    fps: int
    confidence: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    resolution: str
    settings: str
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation
Keep existing `dynamic_performance_predictor.py` but add new calculator:

```python
# In dynamic_performance_predictor.py
from src.fps_calculator import SimplifiedFPSCalculator, AdvancedFPSPredictor

class DynamicPerformancePredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.legacy_calculator = PerformanceCalculator()  # Old
        self.new_calculator = SimplifiedFPSCalculator()   # New
        
    def assess_performance(self, ...):
        # Use new calculator for FPS
        fps_prediction = self.new_calculator.calculate_fps(...)
        
        # Keep existing tier/score logic
        tier = self._get_tier(total_score)
        
        return PerformanceAssessment(
            expected_fps=fps_prediction.fps,
            confidence=fps_prediction.confidence,
            ...
        )
```

### Phase 2: Gradual Refactoring
Extract and simplify components:

```python
# Before: 1184 lines in one file
class DynamicPerformancePredictor:
    def detect_all()       # Hardware detection
    def calculate_scores() # Score calculation
    def predict_fps()      # FPS prediction
    def assess()          # Overall assessment

# After: Separate, focused modules
hardware_detector.py    # 200 lines
score_calculator.py     # 150 lines  
fps_calculator.py       # 430 lines
performance_assessor.py # 200 lines
```

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Old Method (Problematic)
```python
# Complex, unbounded calculation
def _calculate_expected_fps(self, tier, gpu_score, cpu_score, game_requirements, hardware):
    base_fps = {S: 90, A: 75, B: 60, ...}[tier]
    gpu_ratio = user_gpu_benchmark / rec_gpu_score  # Can be 5.0+
    predicted_fps = base_fps * gpu_ratio * cpu_modifier * resolution_factor
    
    # Multiple additional multipliers
    if well_optimized_game:
        fps *= 1.2
    if exceeds_recommended:
        fps *= 1.3
    if gpu_score >= 90:
        fps += 20
        
    return max(15, fps)  # No upper bound!
```

### New Method (Elegant)
```python
# Simple, bounded calculation
def calculate_fps(self, gpu_model, cpu_score, resolution, game_name, quality):
    base_fps = BASE_FPS_1080P[quality]
    
    # Clear, named factors
    resolution_factor = RESOLUTION_FACTORS[resolution_tier]
    gpu_factor = GPU_GENERATION_FACTORS[gpu_generation]
    game_modifier = GAME_PROFILE_MODIFIERS[game_profile]
    cpu_factor = self._calculate_cpu_factor(cpu_score)
    
    # Single calculation
    fps = base_fps * resolution_factor * gpu_factor * game_modifier * cpu_factor
    
    # Context-aware bounds
    return self._apply_realistic_bounds(fps, resolution, quality, game_profile)
```

## Benefits of New Approach

### 1. **Predictable Results**
- FPS predictions always within realistic ranges
- No more "1000 FPS for Cyberpunk" predictions
- Context-aware maximum values

### 2. **Maintainable Code**
- 63% reduction in code size (1184 â†’ 430 lines)
- Clear data structures instead of nested logic
- Easy to add new GPUs or games

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- Confidence scores tell users how reliable the prediction is
- Separate predictions for DLSS/RTX features
- Smart recommendations based on actual FPS

### 4. **Testable**
```python
def test_fps_bounds():
    calc = SimplifiedFPSCalculator()
    result = calc.calculate_fps(
        "RTX 4090", 100, (3840, 2160), "Cyberpunk", "Ultra"
    )
    assert result.fps <= 90  # 4K Ultra can't exceed this
    assert result.fps >= 30  # Should be playable
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Add bounds to existing FPS calculations
2. **Short-term**: Integrate new calculator in parallel
3. **Long-term**: Refactor entire predictor into focused modules

## Example Usage

```python
# Simple API
from src.fps_calculator import SimplifiedFPSCalculator

calculator = SimplifiedFPSCalculator()
prediction = calculator.calculate_fps(
    gpu_model="RTX 4070",
    cpu_score=75,
    resolution=(1920, 1080),
    game_name="Diablo 4",
    quality_preset="High"
)

print(f"{prediction.fps} FPS @ {prediction.resolution}")
print(f"Confidence: {prediction.confidence:.0%}")

# Advanced API with RTX features
predictor = AdvancedFPSPredictor()
result = predictor.predict_with_features(hardware, game_requirements)

print(f"Standard: {result['base_fps']} FPS")
print(f"With DLSS: {result['dlss_fps']} FPS")
print(f"With RT: {result['rt_fps']} FPS")
```

## Summary

The new approach provides:
- **Simplicity**: 430 lines vs 1184 lines
- **Accuracy**: Bounded, realistic predictions
- **Clarity**: Easy to understand and maintain
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend for new hardware
- **Confidence**: Users know how reliable predictions are

This is a much more elegant solution that solves the FPS calculation problems while being easier to maintain and extend.
